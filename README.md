# Personal Portfolio Website
Hi there! Thanks for checking out the repo for my latest portfolio website. On addition to being a portfolio website, the website itself is also a personal project that I started to experiment with React and Tailwind CSS. I feel that I have grown quite a bit since I first started out as a developer, so I wanted to create something to show what I've done and learned.

Check it out here:

## What I've used
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for code editing
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for utility-first CSS classes and responsive styling
- [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/) a Tailwind CSS component library, for cleaner HTML. Not a big fan of how Tailwind bloats a HTML file with so many CSS classes to the point its unreadable, so using Daisy UI was an attempt to use Tailwind CSS in a cleaner way.
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) for modular CSS. Also another attempt at cleaner HTML.

- [react-scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll) for smooth vertical scrolling effect
